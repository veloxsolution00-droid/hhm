print("""Key observations:
1. Single questions work fast (0.03-0.05s) with proper answers and citations
2. Multi-questions are detected as 'multi_question' type and return multiple answers
3. The answer content may be similar across multi-questions if the evidence overlaps
4. Complex questions take longer (247s for the big legal question)""")

# Question and retrieval pipeline implementation

This build adds the requested modular layout while preserving the existing FastAPI, Streamlit, ingestion, storage, and public chat API. Integration changes are limited to `app/rag/chat.py` (to invoke planning, retrieval ranking, evidence selection, and coverage reporting) and `app/core/config.py` (the maximum planned parts default is now 10). Existing storage formats and data directories are unchanged.

## Added modules

- `app/question/classifier.py`: intent and long-question classification.
- `app/question/context_resolver.py`: bounded conversation-history cleaning and follow-up prompt construction.
- `app/question/query_planner.py`: conservative decomposition of explicit and long compound questions, retaining the original question and reporting truncation.
- `app/retrieval/dense_search.py`, `keyword_search.py`, `fusion.py`, `reranker.py`, `evidence_selector.py`, `pipeline.py`: ranking adapters, reciprocal-rank fusion, lightweight reranking, bounded context selection, and query-term coverage.
- `app/reasoning/scenario_analyzer.py`, `comparison.py`, `calculator.py`, `summarizer.py`, `conflict_resolver.py`, `answer_planner.py`: focused reasoning instructions/adapters and per-requirement coverage tracking.
- `app/rag/prompts.py`, `answer_schema.py`, `answer_validator.py`: prompt composition, response record typing, and citation validation adapter.
- `app/evaluation/question_suite.py`, `retrieval_metrics.py`, `answer_metrics.py`: labeled question-suite loading and retrieval/answer coverage metrics.

## Long-question execution

When the incoming question is long and contains recognizable separate requirements, the planner creates up to 10 subquestions. Each subquestion independently calls the existing answer/retrieval path, so one weak requirement does not prevent retrieval for the others. The response includes `question_plan`, per-question `answers`, and `coverage` with answered/unanswered requirement counts. If the configured maximum is exceeded, `truncated_to_limit` is set; increase `max_question_parts` if your questions routinely contain more than 10 requirements.

## Honest implementation boundaries

- The dense and keyword modules are adapters over the current store's shared candidate results; they do not create separate persistent indexes. The existing store already combines Chroma semantic results and SQLite FTS keyword hits.
- The reranker is deterministic lexical/score reranking, not a trained cross-encoder.
- Term coverage is a diagnostic, not proof that a passage entails the answer. It can mark synonymous wording as missing or unrelated word overlap as covered.
- Intent classification and decomposition are heuristic; unusual prose may not split perfectly. Inspect `question_plan` and validate with real labeled documents.
- Citation validation checks reference syntax/range, not semantic entailment.
- The evaluation helpers do not fabricate correctness labels; semantic answer correctness still requires ground-truth labels or human review.


## Caching

The current implementation uses a bounded process-local in-memory cache for query embeddings, retrieval results, and exact successful cited answers. Entries are scoped by owner, corpus fingerprint, configuration fingerprint, and question type, and are bounded by TTL and entry count. Cache contents are disposable and are cleared when the backend process restarts; they are not stored in SQLite. Semantic retrieval reuse is enabled through a high cosine threshold and numeric-anchor checks. Semantic answer reuse remains disabled by default.
